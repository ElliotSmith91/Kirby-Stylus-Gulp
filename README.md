# kirby_gulp_stylus

A directory template and front-end development tool for using automation tools like Browser Sync and Gulp alongside Kirby CMS.

Utilises Stylus and automatic cache-busting on CSS, so long as your main stylus file is called app.styl.

There are lots of improvements to be made to this basic structure etc. but I hope some people out there find it useful for now.

I've had to change this a lot over the past few months due to wanting new features and things, you can see some of the original thinking of gulpfiles etc in my other repos.
